# Mini website builder

This is a mini website builder built using Nextjs 15 and typescript. A drag-and-drop-based tool for creating web page designs. Users can customize their design by adding pre-made sections (e.g., header, hero, footer) to a live preview area. It also supports import/export functionality, allowing users to save and load designs as JSON.

## Instructions

- In the home page follow the start button.
- Once you are in the building dashboard you can start dragging UI elements from the panel on the left.
- Once you are satisfied with your design you can export it to a JSON file by clicking on "Export" on the bottom-left corner.
- You can always import your design by clicking on "Import" in the bottom-left corner and providing a valid JSON design file.

## Notes

- Current pre-made designs are limited and could be expanded later.
